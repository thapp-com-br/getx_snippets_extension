## Classes
### getmain
Quickly rewrite your file **main.dart**  
**getmain** snippet will bring you the complete class, you just need to set your **home**

wait for the snippet and that's it !

![](examples/getmain.gif)

### getmodel

**getmodel** snippet a complete model will return, with the functions fromJson and toJson.   
**Using:** In an empty file, start writing **getmodel**,  
Wait for the snippet, name your class and you're done

![](examples/getmodel.gif)

### getrxmodel

**getrxmodel** snippet a complete model will return, with the functions fromJson and toJson.   
**Using:** In an empty file, start writing **getrxmodel**,  
Wait for the snippet, name your class and you're done

![](examples/getrxmodel.gif)

### getpage
Quickly create, Stateless classes with widget and reactive features provided by [Get](https://pub.dev/packages/get), GetX,  
**getpage** snippet, will bring you a complete stateless class, you only need to indicate:  
- The name of your Page;  
- The name of your Repository;  
- The widget **parent** of **GetX**.
- The name of your Controller,
- The widget child of **GetX**.  
**Using:** When creating a file ***my_page.dart*** empty, you can start by writing **getpage**,  
wait for the snippet, define the necessary data and ready!!  
>> **IMPORTANT TIP:** To take full advantage of using this extension, when generating classes with more than one attribute to be defined, you can define them sequentially, every full word press **TAB** to go to the next expected attribute, many snippets do that.

![](examples/getpage.gif)

### getpagesroutes
Quickly create, a class to manage your Routes with [Get](https://pub.dev/packages/get)  
**getroutepages** snippet, will bring you a complete Route class, you just need to add more routes.  
**Using:** When creating a file ***app_pages.dart*** empty, you can start by writing **getpagesroutes**,  
wait for the snippet and that's it !  
We decided to separate your routes from their ** getpage ** functions through a ** part and part of ** so that your file is smaller and can make it easier to refactor your project, changing your routepage only in its ** app_routes file constant. dart **

![](examples/getpagesroutes.gif)

### getpageroute
Now that you have the routes class, easily add another route with navigation [Get](https://pub.dev/packages/get)  
**getpageroute** snippet, will bring you complete route, you will only define the url and your page in an easy way.

wait for the snippet and that's it !

![](examples/getpageroute.gif)

### getroutes
Now that you have our App Pages class in our **app_pages.dart** file, let's create a new file at the same level, within the routes folder.  
Give it the name **app_routes**, it will only be responsible for saving your routes in constants, this will facilitate the **location** of your routes and you can exchange all the flames of a **single** route just by changing the value of your constant for that. So come on.  
with the **app_routes.dart** file created, start typing **getroutes**.  
This will return us a small abstract class with its constants and some example routes :D 

![](examples/getroutes.gif)

### getroute

> Notice that in the example we are using ***initState*** to enter a value for our variable. 
>We did this so that you can see that a statefull widget is not necessary when using ***Get***, you could start your page by calling >a ***controller function*** that retrieves all your users and inserting them into a ***variable in your controller***, for example, then just use >the same controller your controller inside the GetX widget.

>**Note** that we are not initializing our controller in the example. This is because we are assuming that you are calling this form in a "login" class, where we start it.
>This is because the view that is consuming this widget has the same controller, this was possible because we used 'asignId: true' in our GetX widget
